### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of
classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java) is
in charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts
e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`,
inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the
visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [
`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [
`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API
call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates
   a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which
   is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take
   several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as
  a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [
`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [
`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* saves and reads both address book data and user preference data in JSON format.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component as it needs to save/retrieve objects part of `Model`.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

There are two parts to the commons:

1. `commons.core`
    - classes essentially to functionality of app
    - `Config.java`, `GuiSettings` etc<br><br>

2. `commons.util`
    - classes used to add additional functionality
    - `FileUtil.java`: For reading file paths.
    - `HashingUtil.java`: For providing hashing functionality.
    - `ConfigUtil.java`: For reading and saving user configurations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo
history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the
following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€” Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€” Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€” Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()`
and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the
initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command
calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes
to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book
state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also
calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into
the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing
the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer`
once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the opposite â€” it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once
to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such
as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`.
Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not
pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be
purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern
desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Glossary

* **MSS**: Main Scenario Success
* **MVP**: Features that are must-haves for DeskFlow
* **Users**: Users of the DeskFlow application
* **Administrator**: Person with authority with the ability to add or remove users, change permissions, change data
  directly
* **IT Staff**: Person that works with DeskFLow more, has the ability to toggle column visibility, search for
  organization members, edit service tag field, and manages data in DeskFlow.
* **Organization Member**: Members of the organization are the contacts that are managed within the DeskFlow
* **orgID**: Unique staff identifier given to all employees
* **Natural Language**: Natural language in searching refers to using human-like, conversational queries instead of
  keyword-based searches to find information. (i.e. "best smartphones 2024" and "what are the best smartphones in
  2024" )
* **Devices**: The laptop / device that each organization member posesses. E.g. Some users may have systems such as a
  MacBook, ThinkPad, etc.
* **CSV**:  CSV (comma-separated values) is a plain text file format that stores data in a table. CSVs are commonly
  used to store spreadsheets and databases.
* **Tabular Format**: Tabular format refers to data or information that is organized in a table format,
  typically using rows and columns. This structure makes it easier to read, analyze, and process data systematically.
* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS
* **SSH**: SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol that allows secure remote access to another computer
  over an unsecured network. It is commonly used for remote login, file transfers, and command execution on servers.
* **Java**: Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems
  (now owned by Oracle) in 1995. It is designed to be platform-independent, meaning that Java programs can run on any
  system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

*Team Size: 4*

### 1. UserInterface: Inconsistent / jittery resizing behaviour in contact card

We make use of the `TitledPane` component in JavaFX to create a contact card that can be expanded and collapsed.
However, in order to fit stylized, non-text components in the header, we have had to "hack" it into the `graphics`
property of the `TitledPane`, which is not size-responsive. While we have created a function to manually resize the
component, this function is not called instantaneously, or may be suspended on occasion. Some instances where such
behaviour is observed include:

- Quickly resizing width
- Editing fields with vastly different size
- Right-clicking to copy a label / hovering over a label when the tooltip appears

We plan to fix this by no longer using a `TitledPane`, and instead implementing a custom expandable component from
scratch.

### 2. UserInterface: Unicode not consistent on all OS

We make use of Unicode characters as icons. However, the manner in which these characters are rendered is not
consistent across different devices. In some OS, they may be rendered as a square, or not rendered at all. We plan
to address this by setting up a fallback font similar
to [this implementation](https://github.com/duoduobingbing/javafx-custom-font-fallback-demo)

We intend to make use of a patched font from [NerdFonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts), which supports an
extended number of icons. We have already received [approval](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S2/forum/issues/490)
for this change as an external library for this project.

### 3. Command Syntax Highlighter: Is not consistent with parser.

The command syntax highlighter only distinguishes between commands, prefixes, and arguments. However, the parser may
reject commands on a basis such as invalid arguments, repeated or unique prefixes, or invalid authorization for a
command, which is not reflected in the syntax highlighter.

In order to build a more robust syntax highlighter, we plan to enforce that validation should be done at the
individual parser level, and not at the ui level. This would likely mean adding to a `Parser` interface to validate
and return a set of arguments.

### 5. Authentication: Add a new user workflow, and allow chaning credentials

Currently, only prebuilt admin account is allowed. In a future implementation we will direct new app users to a
register page to create the admin account. This will allow adding of multiple admin account and modifying of IT
staff and admin credentials to offer a smoother DeskFlow experience.

### 6. Editing orgID collapses titlePane

When a user with an expanded titlePane is edited the titlePane should stay expanded to maximise user experience. In
a future implementation we plan to add a Focus command to allow users to expand a titlePane of their choice to make
DeskFlow more friendly for CLI users.
