### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of
classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java) is
in charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts
e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`,
inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the
visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [
`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [
`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>


Here's another (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram2.png" width="300"/>

This class diagram illustrates the part of the `Logic` component that handles register and login.


The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API
call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates
   a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which
   is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take
   several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as
  a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [
`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [
`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* saves and reads both address book data, account book data and user preference data in JSON format.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `AccountBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component as it needs to save/retrieve objects part of `Model`.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

There are two parts to the commons:

1. `commons.core`
    - classes essentially to functionality of app
    - `Config.java`, `GuiSettings` etc<br><br>

2. `commons.util`
    - classes used to add additional functionality
    - `FileUtil.java`: For reading file paths.
    - `HashingUtil.java`: For providing hashing functionality.
    - `ConfigUtil.java`: For reading and saving user configurations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

Here are some example features implemented in DeskFlow.

### Login feature

The login feature is done through the `LoginDialog` and `AuthenticateCommand`. `Logic` checks if user exists and if so
allows the `LoginDialog` to appear.
On entering valid credentials, an `AuthenticateCommand` is created and calls `Logic#LogUserIn()` to provide user with
the elevated privileges.
The following sequence is illustrated below
![Login](images/LoginSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

### Register feature

The register feature is done similarly through the `RegisterDialog` and `CreateUserCommand`. `Logic` first creates a
`RegisterCommand` that
checks `Model` if a user is already registered, and if so throws an error which prevents registering of multiple
accounts.
If no user has been registered, the `RegisterDialog` will be constructed to create a new user.
The sequence for the register feature is shown below.

![Register](images/RegisterSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

### Import feature

The import feature is facilitated by the existing `StorageManager`. It uses the `Storage#readAddressBook()` method to
read from the file location provided.
It then replaces the existing address book using `Model#setAddressBook()`. Given below is the sequence diagram showing
approximately how the AddressBook is updated.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

*Team Size: 4*

### 1. UserInterface: Inconsistent / jittery resizing behaviour in contact card

We make use of the `TitledPane` component in JavaFX to create a contact card that can be expanded and collapsed.
However, in order to fit stylized, non-text components in the header, we have had to "hack" it into the `graphics`
property of the `TitledPane`, which is not size-responsive. While we have created a function to manually resize the
component, this function is not called instantaneously, or may be suspended on occasion. Some instances where such
behaviour is observed include:

- Quickly resizing width
- Editing fields with vastly different size
- Right-clicking to copy a label / hovering over a label when the tooltip appears
- If the window is left inactive or not in focus for a while

We plan to fix this by no longer using a `TitledPane`, and instead implementing a custom expandable component from
scratch.

### 2. UserInterface: Unicode not consistent on all OS

We make use of Unicode characters as icons. However, the manner in which these characters are rendered is not
consistent across different devices. In some OS, they may be rendered as a square, or not rendered at all. We plan
to address this by setting up a fallback font similar
to [this implementation](https://github.com/duoduobingbing/javafx-custom-font-fallback-demo)

We intend to make use of a patched font from [NerdFonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts), which supports an
extended number of icons. We have already received [approval](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S2/forum/issues/490)
for this change as an external library for this project.

### 3. Command Syntax Highlighter: Is not consistent with parser.

The command syntax highlighter only distinguishes between commands, prefixes, and arguments. However, the parser may
reject commands on a basis such as invalid arguments, repeated or unique prefixes, or invalid authorization for a
command, which is not reflected in the syntax highlighter. On the other hand, the syntax highlighter may show a warning 
for additional whitespace or extra characters, which are ignored by the parser.

This may be confusing to the user if the syntax highlighter shows a command as valid, but the parser rejects it, and 
the same goes for the opposite.

In order to build a more robust syntax highlighter that is consistent with the parser, we plan to add to a `Parser` 
interface such that should be done at the individual parser level, and not at the ui level as it is now. 

### 4. Editing orgID collapses `TitlePane`

When the addressbook is modified, the Ui must independently preserve the state of which `TitlePane` is expanded or 
collapsed. We make use of the `orgId` associated with the contact in each titlePane to uniquely identify the contact 
within, and to preserve the expanded or collapsed state. However, when the orgID is changed, this method no longer 
works.

To fix this, in the future we will assign each contact `TitlePane` a unique ID instead of using the `orgId`. This ID 
will remain persistent regardless of the values assigned to the contact.

### 5. `findby` Command: Does not validate input fields

Unlike other commands that accept multiple prefixes, the `findby` command does not validate the values for 
each prefix. One reason for this is convenience, since rather than type out the status `servicing`, the user can simply 
type `ser`.

Unfortunately, this is still limited, since it does not prevent the user from typing an invalid status that will 
never match with any contact such as `ser1`.

Thus, in the future, we will implement an additional validation step that will at least check if the value may be a 
partial match based on the constraints of a prefix. Our approach to this would be to add a partial validation 
function in addition to the existing validation functions in `ParserUtil.java`.

### 6. Adding / Modifying / Deleting a contact resets any filtered view

If a user is currently viewing a filtered list of contacts either through `find`, `findby`, or `filter-status`, and 
if they choose to modify the addressbook by adding, modifying, or deleting a contact, the filtered view will be 
reset to show all contacts.

The simplest solution to this would be to display a message in the result box to the user, such that the change is 
not unexpected. Furthermore, it is reasonable to assume that the user may wish to see the changes made as a whole, 
not to mention that the added contact may not exist within the filter, which is confusing.

However, in the long term, we plan on adding a variable to store and persist the current filtered state within 
`LogicManager.java`, by storing the active `Predicate`. If the modification were to lie outside of the filtered view,
the filtered view would be reset with a message displayed. Otherwise, the filtered view would be preserved.

### 7. UserInterface: `toggle-expand` command

Currently, if a user wishes to expand or collapse all the `TitlePane` components, they must do so by clicking on the 
GUI. However, since DeskFlow is intended to be a `CLI-first` application, this is not ideal. We wish to expand on 
the feature by adding a command to perform the same action.

We plan to implement a `toggle-expand` command that will allow the user to expand or collapse all the `TitlePane` 
components. This will have to go hand in with fixing the aforementioned fix of storing the state of the 
`TitlePane` as a unique identifier.

### 8. Authentication: No password reset, password recovery

To satisfy the single user constraints of the project we have locked down DeskFlow to a single user with a fixed set of
credentials registered at the start of launch. However, this hinders user experience as user might forget or want to
reset their passwords. Currently, the only way is to manually delete the accounts.json stored and register again.
Thus, we plan to add functionality for password reset and recovery in a future implementation of DeskFlow.

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Difficulty Level
Moderate to High. The project required integrating diverse functionalities ranging from backend logic (e.g., user login) to UI enhancements. 
Complexity grew with the interaction between modules and the need to ensure a smooth user experience.

### Challenges Faced
- **Login Function:** This was the hardest part of the implementation due to state handling and logic issues. Ensuring proper validation and maintaining user state across the UI required significant debugging and testing.
- **UI Changes:** These were the trickiest due to layout constraints, responsiveness, and making the interface intuitive. UI work demanded constant tweaking and iteration, especially when incorporating new fields and functionality without breaking existing layouts.
- **Import Function:** Required parsing and handling various file types and edge cases, such as missing or malformed data.
- **Syntax Highlighting:** While not conceptually difficult, integrating it cleanly into the editor added to the workload.

### Effort Required
Overall, the project demanded a high level of consistent commitment, development and testing effort over a long period of time. 
UI work and login functionality consumed the majority of the time, with each requiring deep troubleshooting and design iteration. Coordination between front-end and back-end also required careful attention to avoid regressions.

### Achievements
- Successfully integrated a file import feature.
- Added syntax highlighting, improving the user experience for code editing.
- Implemented a functioning (though initially buggy) login feature.
- Enhanced the UI with additional fields and visual improvements.
- Addressed multiple bug cycles and maintained backward compatibility.
- Sense of satisfaction finally being done.

The project overall marks solid progress in both functionality and polish, opening the doors for further improvements.
