## Quick start

### Installation

> **Tip**
>
> For experienced users, the latest release of DeskFlow is available as a `.jar`
> file  [here](https://github.cob/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/releases),
> or you may wish to build the project from [source](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-2/tp). Ensure you have
> Java `17` installed.

#### Step 1. Install Java `17` or Above

##### Windows / Linux

Chances are, if you are using Windows or Linux, you already have Java installed.
To verify if you have a compatible version of Java,
open a Command Prompt on Windows, or a terminal
on Linux, and run the command `java -version`. You should see an output similar to either of the following:

```bash
java version "17.0.1" 2021-10-19 LTS
openjdk version "17.0.14" 2025-01-21
```

If you do not have Java installed, or if you have a version lower than `17` you may follow the installation
instructions for Windows [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationWindows.html), and
Linux [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationLinux.html).

##### Mac OS

You must follow the instructions  [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html) to
install a specific version of the Java Development Kit (JDK).

To verify a successful installation, open a terminal and run the command `java -version`. You should see an output
similar to the following:

```bash
java version "17.0.14.fx-zulu" 2021-10-19 LTS
```

#### 2. Download DeskFlow

DeskFlow is available as a Java ARchive (JAR) file, terminating in `.jar`. Install the JAR file from our latest
release [here](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/releases).

#### 3. Creating a DeskFlow Home Folder

A home folder is the directory where the DeskFlow application's `.jar`, as well as your data files, will be stored.
We recommend creating a new folder in your home directory called `DeskFlow` for this purpose. Copy the previously
downloaded `DeskFlow.jar` file into this folder.

### Usage

*Ensure that you have followed steps 1-3 from the installation.*

1. Open a command terminal, and run `cd /home/folder` to navigate to the home folder, and run `java -jar DeskFlow.jar`
   command in the terminal to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear.
    - Employee records will only show after you login.

![UI Image](images/StartUi.png)

Here are some key elements of the UI you should be familiar with after you login:<br>
![UI Image with labels](images/LabelledUi.png)

- **Main Menu:** Here, you can conveniently login, access help if you're stuck, or change the file to which the address
  book is saved.
- **Command Input:** This is where you type commands to interact with the address book.
- **Command Result:** When you enter a command, its result will be displayed in this box.
- **Result Table:** When listing or viewing employees, they will be presented in a table here, whereby each column is
  associated with a field in the header.
- **Person Card:** A single employee is represented in a person card, which displays all of their relevant information.
  These cards are collapsed by default.
- **Saved File:** The file that this address book is saved to.

2. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will
   open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

- `login`: A pop-up appears for you to log in to your account.
- `list`: Lists all employees.
-
`add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 t/Urgent i/123 d/DeviceInfoXYZ st/pending_approval`:
Adds a employee named `John Doe` to DeskFlow.
- `delete 3`: Deletes the 3rd employee shown in the current list.
- `set-status 3 st/none`: Sets the status of the 3rd employee to `none`.
- `filter-status st/none`: Filter all employees that have `none` as a status.
- `clear`: Deletes all employees.
- `logout`: Logs out of account.
- `exit`: Exits the app.

3. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Information for testers

If you are testing DeskFlow the following admin credentials will be useful for you.

username: Admin  
password: Admin@123

To test with IT staff privileges, you can log in with admin and register a new user.

1. Run `login` and enter with admin credential.
2. Next run `register` and enter username and password for the new IT staff.
3. Run `logout`.
4. Then run `login` again but with the new credentials created.
5. You now have restricted access to functions as an IT staff.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Notes about reading the command format:**<br>

- Commands are case-sensitive and should all be in small letters.
- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
- Words in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/Urgent` or as `n/John Doe`.
- Items with `…` after them can be added multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/InternetIssue`, `t/SoftwareIssue t/Urgent` etc.
- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, `login`, `logout`
  and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines
  as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

AddressBook data can be imported from an existing AddressBook JSON file.

Format: `import PATH`

Example:

- `import data\import.json` **replaces** existing data with the imported JSON.

![import screenshot](images/import_screenshot.png "import example")

- You should see a success message after successfully importing.
  ![successful import](images/successful_import.png "successful import example")

Additional Information:

- You can use either relative (`data/imported_AB.json`) or absolute
  path (`C:\Users\keega\Documents\tp\data\import.json`).
- You should use the pathing convention that matches your Operating System for better results.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Importing a new data file will completely replace the existing address book. Hence, you are recommended to make a backup of the file before importing.
</div>

### Saving data

Your DeskFlow data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need for
you to save
manually. You can see where the data is stored at the bottom of the DeskFlow window.

### Editing data file

Your DeskFlow employee data i automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`.
Advanced
users are
welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, DeskFlow will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to make a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause DeskFlow to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**:
You should install DeskFlow on the other computer and overwrite the empty JSON data file with the JSON file of your
previous DeskFlow application.
You can find your previous JSON file in the home folder.

**Q**: Is there a way to undo an accidental employee deletion?<br>
**A**:
Unfortunately you cannot undo an accidental employee deletion, but it is possible to add the employee back again.

**Q**: Who has access to employee data?<br>
**A**:
Only Admin users or IT staff users that are logged in can access and read the employee data.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only
   the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the
   application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard
   shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy
   is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. You might not see icons rendering correctly depending on your Operating System. We are working on allowing icons to
   be universally visible.
